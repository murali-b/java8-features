   (parameter_list) -> {function_body}

   2. Parameter list
   3. Body – This is the main part of the function.
   4. No return type – The java 8 compiler is able to infer the return type by checking the code. you need not to mention it explicitly.
2. Java 8 – Method references
   Method reference is a short and concise way to call methods, static methods and even constructors without any lengthy syntax. 
   Method references help to point to methods by their names even without specifying the arguments. Arguments are passed by the lambda expression. A method reference is described using "::" symbol.
